        <p>I am interested in Web Development because I like websites. They allow me and others to interact with the wealth of information the internet has to offer. I like visiting websites with good layouts and pleasing features, so one day I aspire to make websites that other people will enjoy visiting as well. (Also, I kind of just think it's fun.)</p>
